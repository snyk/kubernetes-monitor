# Default values for snyk-monitor.

# The snyk-monitor relies on several k8s secrets in order to be configured properly.
# These secrets are named "snyk-monitor-secrets", though you can change the name.
# The secrets should be created externally, before applying this Helm chart.
# The currently used keys within the secret are: "dockercfg.json", "integrationId".
