## Summary ##

A Helm chart for the Snyk monitor

## Installing ##

The Snyk monitor (`kubernetes-monitor`) requires some minimal configuration items in order to work correctly.

As with any Helm chart deployment, a namespace must be provisioned first.
You can run the following command to create the namespace:
```shell
kubectl create namespace snyk-monitor
```
Notice our namespace is called _snyk-monitor_ and it is used for the following commands in scoping the resources.


The Snyk monitor relies on using your Snyk Integration ID, which must be provided from a Kubernetes secret. The secret must be called _snyk-monitor_. The steps to create the secret are as such:

1. Locate your Snyk Integration ID from the Snyk Integrations page (navigate to https://app.snyk.io/org/YOUR-ORGANIZATION-NAME/manage/integrations/kubernetes) and copy it.
The Snyk Integration ID is a UUID and looks similar to the following:
```
abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd1234
```
The Snyk Integration ID is used in the `--from-literal=integrationId=` parameter in the next step.

2. If you are not using any private registries, create a Kubernetes secret called `snyk-monitor` containing the Snyk Integration ID from the previous step running the following command:
 ```shell
 kubectl create secret generic snyk-monitor -n snyk-monitor --from-literal=dockercfg.json={} --from-literal=integrationId=abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd1234
 ```
 Continue to Helm installation instructions below.

3. If we're using a private registry, you should create a `dockercfg` file. The `dockercfg` file is necessary to allow the monitor to look up images in private registries. Usually a copy of the `dockercfg` resides in `$HOME/.docker/config.json`.

Create a file named `dockercfg.json`. Store your `dockercfg` in there; it should look like this:

```json
{
  "auths": {
    "gcr.io": {
      "auth": "<BASE64-ENCODED-AUTH-DETAILS>"
    }
    // Add other registries as necessary
  }
}
```
Finally, create the secret in Kubernetes by running the following command:
```shell
kubectl create secret generic snyk-monitor -n snyk-monitor --from-file=./dockercfg.json --from-literal=integrationId=abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd1234
```

4. If your private registry requires installing certificates (*.crt, *.cert, *.key only) please put them in a folder and create the following ConfigMap:
```shell
kubectl create configmap snyk-monitor-certs -n snyk-monitor --from-file=<path_to_certs_folder>
```

5. If you are using an insecure registry or your registry is using unqualified images, you can provide a `registries.conf` file. See [the documentation](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/docs/containers-registries.conf.5.md) for information on the format and examples.

Create a file named `registries.conf`, see example adding an insecure registry: 

```
[[registry]]
location = "internal-registry-for-example.net/bar"
insecure = true
```

Once you've created the file, you can use it to create the following ConfigMap:
```shell
kubectl create configmap snyk-monitor-registries-conf -n snyk-monitor --from-file=<path_to_registries_conf_file>
```

## Installation from Helm repo ##

Add Snyk's Helm repo:

```shell
helm repo add snyk-charts https://snyk.github.io/kubernetes-monitor/
```

Run the following command to launch the Snyk monitor in your cluster. If your Kubernetes cluster uses PodSecurityPolicies you will also need to set `use_psp` to `true`.

```shell
helm upgrade --install snyk-monitor snyk-charts/snyk-monitor --namespace snyk-monitor --set clusterName="Production cluster"
```

To better organise the data scanned inside your cluster, the monitor requires a cluster name to be set.
Replace the value of `clusterName` with the name of your cluster.


For Helm 3, you may run the following:
```shell
helm upgrade --generate-name --install snyk-monitor snyk-charts/snyk-monitor --namespace snyk-monitor --set clusterName="Production cluster"
```

## Setting up proxying ##

Proxying traffic through a forwarding proxy can be achieved by setting the following values in the Helm chart:

* http_proxy
* https_proxy
* no_proxy

For example:

```bash
helm upgrade --install snyk-monitor snyk-charts/snyk-monitor \
  --namespace snyk-monitor \
  --set clusterName="Production cluster" \
  --set https_proxy=http://192.168.99.100:8080
```

The `snyk-monitor` currently works with HTTP proxies only.

Note that `snyk-monitor` does not proxy requests to the Kubernetes API server.

Note that `snyk-monitor` does not support wildcards or CIDR addresses in `no_proxy` -- it will only look for exact matches. For example:

```bash
# not ok:
helm upgrade --install ... \
  --set no_proxy=*.example.local,*.other.global,192.168.0.0/16

# ok:
helm upgrade --install ... \
  --set no_proxy=long.domain.name.local,example.local
```
