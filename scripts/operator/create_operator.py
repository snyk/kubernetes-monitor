""" Creates an Operator using Operator template files in this repository.

Inputs:
- $1: The full Operator image name and tag, e.g. "snyk/kubernetes-operator:1.2.3"
- $2: The snyk-monitor image tag, e.g. "1.2.3"

Output:
- Creates a copy of the snyk-monitor Helm chart under the snyk-operator
- Builds a Docker image with the name passed in input "$1"

Creates an Operator using Operator template files in this repository.
The template files should have been previously generated by using the operator-sdk.

By using the template files, this script copies over the Helm chart and makes some minor
replacements to ensure the latest built snyk-monitor tag is used in the Operator. This way
users get all the default values of the chart, and are always pointing to the correct image tag.
